#  â˜• Coffee Machine â€“ OOP Python Project

A simple console-based coffee machine simulation written in Python. 

This project demonstrates object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts such as classes, inheritance, and encapsulation, as well as a structured approach to managing resources, handling payments, and user interactions.

## Features

* 3 drink options: Espresso, Latte, and Cappuccino
* Ingredient and resource management
* Coin-based payment system with change calculation
* Reporting mode to display remaining resources and profit

Shutdown command (off)

## Project Structure
</pre>
â”œâ”€â”€ main.py             # Main program to run the coffee machine
â”œâ”€â”€ menu.py             # Menu and drink definitions
â”œâ”€â”€ coffee_maker.py     # Handles machine resources and making coffee
â”œâ”€â”€ money_machine.py    # Handles coin processing and profit tracking
â”œâ”€â”€ task.py             # Original script with procedural logic
</pre>

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

* Python OOP with classes and methods
* Modular code organization
* Realistic command-line user interface
* Basic validation for user input and system state


## How to Run
1. Clone this repo:

 ```bash 
  python main.py   
 ```

2. Follow the prompt to:

* Order drinks
* Insert coins
* View resource report with report
* Turn off with off

### ðŸ“š Acknowledgment

This coffee machine project is based on the "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp" course by **Dr.â€¯Angelaâ€¯Yu** on Udemy. 
Dr. Angela Yu is a highly-regarded coding instructor, the founder of the London App Brewery.

I created this repository as part of my personal study and review of Python fundamentals.
No major changes were made to the original logic; the main additions are improved structure and documentation via this README.md file.
