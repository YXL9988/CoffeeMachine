#  ☕ Coffee Machine – OOP Python Project

A simple console-based coffee machine simulation written in Python. 

This project demonstrates object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts such as classes, inheritance, and encapsulation, as well as a structured approach to managing resources, handling payments, and user interactions.

## Features

* **3 drink options: Espresso, Latte, and Cappuccino
* **Ingredient and resource management
* **Coin-based payment system with change calculation
* **Reporting mode to display remaining resources and profit

Shutdown command (off)

## Project Structure
</pre>
├── main.py             # Main program to run the coffee machine
├── menu.py             # Menu and drink definitions
├── coffee_maker.py     # Handles machine resources and making coffee
├── money_machine.py    # Handles coin processing and profit tracking
├── task.py             # Original script with procedural logic
</pre>

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

* **Python OOP with classes and methods
* **Modular code organization
* **Realistic command-line user interface
* **Basic validation for user input and system state


## How to Run
1. Clone this repo:

 ```bash 
  python main.py   
 ```

2. Follow the prompt to:

* **Order drinks
* **Insert coins
* **View resource report with report
* **Turn off with off
